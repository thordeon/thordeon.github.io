   		<h3>Are there really<br>10,000 Lakes?!</h3>
    		<p class="righttext">Minnesota consists of extensive woodlands, fertile prairies, and innumerable lakes—the last the basis for one of the state’s nicknames, “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” <br><br>Minnesota actually has about 12,000 lakes, all of which are larger than 10 acres (4 hectares) in area. The nearly 5,000 square miles (13,000 square km) of inland fresh water are a dominant feature in Minnesota.

  			<p class="righttext">Sports in Minnesota include professional teams in all major sports, Olympic Games contenders and medalists, especially in the Winter Olympics, collegiate teams in major and small-school conferences and associations, and active amateur teams and individual sports. <br><br>The State of Minnesota has a team in all four major professional leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL), and the University of Minnesota is part of the oldest major college conference still running (the Big Ten).

    	<h2>Minnesota</h2><h3><i>A State Like No Other</i></h3>
    		<p>The name
“Minnesota” comes from Dakota Indian words meaning “sky-tinted waters,” or “sky-blue waters.” Minnesota’s lakes and rivers are part of what this state is all about. The many lakes are part of what makes it different from all of the other states. One of Minnesota’s nicknames is “Land of 10,000 Lakes,” but it really has a lot more. The state is on the shore of the biggest of the Great Lakes, Lake Superior, and Minnesota is where the world’s third largest river, the Mississippi, begins.<br><br> 

The official seal (to the left) shows a farmer plowing a field near St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River, an Indian riding a horse, and the words “L’Etoile du Nord.” There are more loons (pictured, upper-right) in Minnesota than in any other state except Alaska. These water birds can dive as deep as 250 feet to look for food.<br><br>

Part of Minnesota’s appeal is that it offers four distinct seasons, each with its own particular pleasures: <br>Spring features warming days, with temperatures progressing from 50 degrees to the low 70s by the end of May. Summer brings daytime temperatures in the 70s and 80s and the easygoing days of summer enjoy daylight late into the evening. Fall brings cooling temperatures, starting with daytime highs in the 70s, dropping to highs in the 30s by the end of November. The bright colors of trees and shrubs change from their lush summer green. Winter in Minnesota has earned a reputation for its occasional weather extremes, but the average winter day is quite comfortable for outdoor activities like skiing or snowmobiling. For instance, the average high daytime temperature in the Twin Cities in January, the coldest month, is in the low 20s.
